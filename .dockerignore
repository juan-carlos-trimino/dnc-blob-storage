# Before the docker CLI sends the context to the docker daemon, it looks for a file named '.dockerignore' in the root directory
# of the context. If this file exists, the CLI modifies the context to exclude files and directories that match patterns in it.
# This helps to avoid unnecessarily sending large or sensitive files and directories to the daemon and potentially adding them
# to images using ADD or COPY.
# Ignore everything
